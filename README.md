Examples of how you can get 'pivot table' functionality with
Elasticsearch. Each use case starts with "I have" and "I want", followed
by curl calls to achieve desired functionality.

There are also short Python scripts for parsing the output; these are
only to visualize the data, they do not implement any 'application side'
logic.

If you have a new use case you would like addressed, please raise an
issue.
